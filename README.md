# Analysis of the sacred texts of the 4 major religions using Word2vec embeddings
By using word embeddings models to analyse the sacred texts of the 4 most popular religions is it possible to identify certain characteristics of these religions?

For example, how does the concept of death change between different religions? Is it possible to link God with Buddha? These are some of the questions we tried to answer in this project.
